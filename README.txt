Files:
    Common.Direction.java (The enum representing the direction of travel)
    Elevator.Elevator.java
    Common.ElevatorRequest.java (Encapsulates the data for an elevator request)
    Floor.Floor.java (Represents a single floor in the builing and contains direction and floor lamps)
    Floor.FloorSubsystem.java (Coordinates communication between individual floors and Scheduler.Scheduler)
    Main.java
    Common.RequestStatus.java (The enum representing the direction of travel)
    Scheduler.Scheduler.java

Folder: Elevator.Elevator-Simulator
Inside this folder
    - data.txt which holds all of our test cases
    - UML Class Diagram.pdf
    - UML Class Diagram.pdf
    - UML State Diagram.pdf

then go inside the src folder
    Common.Direction.java
    Elevator.Elevator.java
    Common.ElevatorRequest.java
    Floor.Floor.java
    Floor.FloorSubsystem.java
    Main.java
    Common.RequestStatus.java
    Scheduler.Scheduler.java

To set this up:
1) Open IntelliJ and open the folder from Iteration 2
2) Then go into the src folder which has all the code files and open them all in IntelliJ
3) Go to Main.java and run the code from Main.java

NOTE:
After opening a new project, IntelliJ sometimes highlights many errors in the code incorrectly.
If this happens, you can fix the IDE and force it to reopen the project by following these steps.
    1- Go to File > RepairIDE.
    2- You will see a message pop up in the bottom left corner of the screen.
       If the issue is resolved click on "Everything works now".
       If the issue is not resolved, click on More > Rescan Project Indexes.
    3- You will see another message in the bottom left corner of the screen.
       If the issue is still there, click on "Reopen project".
       This usually resolves the issues with the IDE.
